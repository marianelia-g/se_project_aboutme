            <h3 class="card-title">Homeward Bound</h3>
            <p class="card-text">A few weeks ago, I returned to my home island in the Dominican Republic. I can still taste the sweet succulent mango that soothed my sea-parched lips.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Jumpman</h3>
            <p class="card-text">As a kid, I would spend countless nights hidden under the covers playing Mario 64 on my Nintendo Ds. And although the years have passed, I think back to those careless days where I'd jump into photo frames and fly over desert dunes.</p>

            <p class="card-text">A hot summer day is the best time to watch Hayao Miyazaki’s inspiring tale Kiki’s Delivery Service. This captivating adventure follows Kiki, a young witch in training, who brooms off to a new seaport town to start her very own business --- a flying delivery service! Kiki reminds me we are all capable of beginning anew.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Onward Bound</h3>
            <p class="card-text">Speaking of starting something new, I have begun my own adventure learning software engineering. There are many tough days where I say "Am I capable of flurishing in this field?". Then, I remember the Lord's voice when he said in Isaiah 41:13 "I am the Lord your God, who grasp your right hand; It is I who say to you, Do not fear; I will help you". And my heart fills up with hope knowing the Lord is with me. In the future, I hope to grow my skillset, work with fellow 
                colleague, and create projects that spark joy.</p>
